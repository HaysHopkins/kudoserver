# Note the extra setup instructions added below.
## Tasks

1) 
- [x] Give kudos to other users
- [x] See kudos given to him/her by other users
- [x] View all kudos another user has received

2) Additionally, take a swing at adding one or two of the following improvements:

- [x]  Allow users to be associated with an organization
- [x] Allow logging in as different users (authentication)
  -This needs work to be production ready, but basic outline is there
- [x] Prevent users from being able to do things they shouldn't (authorization)
  -Scoping by team effectively accomplishes this; also prevent self-kudos
- [ ] Enforce a limit on giving kudos (for example, up to 3 kudos per week)
- [ ] Limit the number of information displayed on each page (pagination)


TODO: tests tests tests; change more components to functional/ui, kudos n+1, make sure counter is working (might need to manually update count before reload); empty states; use refresh tokens; need some more sanity limits on validations (FE, BE and DB); get toast to auto close properly


## Setup
1) Install dependencies with `bundle install`
2) Configure your database settings in `config/database.yml`
3) Build your database with `rails db:setup db:seed`
4) Prepare the front end with `npm install`
5) Start your rails server with `rake start`

## Testing
You can hit API endpoints via commandline with curl:

GET: `curl localhost:3000/users`

POST: `curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username":"daenerys", "first_name":"daenerys", "last_name":"targaryen"}' localhost:3000/users`
